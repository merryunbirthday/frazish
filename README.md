## Install

```
git clone https://github.com/Aparus/frazy.git
npm install
```

A complete backend of this app is [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

- Authentication with Google-Provider
- Firestore for DB
- Storage for files
- Hosting
- Cloud Functions for the server code

The client side is bootstraped with [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and logic is written with React and Redux.

To syncronize backend and frontend we use [React-Redux-Firebase](https://react-redux-firebase.com/).

User Interface is written in [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).

To visualize and control audio we use [Wavesurfer.js](https://wavesurfer-js.org/)

All these features above will be installed on your local machine after the `npm i` command, but we shared these links to help you dive into the project and get some theoretical basics about what is used here and how.

To run the whole app with your own cloud backend (for testing), you should create your own project (web-app) on [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and you'll be provided with application credentianls, which you should paste into the file `src/config/firebaseConfig`:

```
export default {
  apiKey: 'xxxx',
  authDomain: 'xxxx',
  databaseURL: 'xxxx',
  projectId: 'xxxx',
  storageBucket: 'xxxx',
  messagingSenderId: 'xxxx',
  appId: 'xxxx'
}
```

The app will work properly on your machine except for uploading files from `localhost` into `Storage`. For that, you should set [cors config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files#cors_configuration).

You can also use external links to audio files in the app (mp3, ogg, etc). But make sure to use `https`, because http can be blocked by a browser while visualizing with web-audio-api.

## Data models

### Material

Material is the basic data model in the whole app. It contains the following fields:

```
 title: 'Great expectations. Chapter 1.',
 lang: 'en',
 unit: 'GreatExpectationsEn',
 order: '001',
 phrases: { 'phrase1id': { start: 1.06, end: 3.48, text: "Chapter One" }, ... },
 mediaLink: 'fileIdInStorageOrExternalHttpsLink', // 'folder/filename.mp3' or 'https://bbc.com/6minutEnglish.mp3'
 duration: 0, // 45.035 (sec)
 translations: [], // ['ru', 'ar', 'ch'],
 createdBy: {
     userId: uid,
     userName: displayName
     },
 createdAt: 'timestamp[13]',
 updatedAt: 'timestamp[13]',
```

`lang` used for sorting materials. It can also affect display options. `lang:'ar'` loads special fonts and styles for Arabic.

`unit` used for assembling headings from the titles of materials of the same unit.

`order` is the order of a heading. If it is not set, createdAt timestamp will be applied by default.

`phrases` - `start`-`end` is a time interval in an audio file, and `text` is the text related to a particular phrase.

`mediaLink` can be fileId in Cloud Storage, if you loaded your local file. Or it can be external httpS link to an audio file: mp3, ogg, etc.

`duration` length of an audio file in seconds.

`translations` - array of avaliable translations. Used for generating links to each translation.

`createdBy` assigned to the material when you add your own material or edit an existing one. Displayed in the latest updates on the site feed and in the revisions section of the material.

`createdAt`, `updatedAt` used for ordering materials into blocks as the latest updates for a particular language, or as the main page with all the events that happened.

### Unit

```
title: 'Great Expectations',
author: 'Charles Dickens',
logo: 'storageId', //png, jpg,
background: 'storageId',
heading: [
    {
        id: materialId,
        title: materialTitle,
        order: '001',
        createdAt: 'timestamp[13]',
        updatedAt: 'timestamp[13]'
    }
]
```

The unit menu appears by clicking on the sandwich menu button in the bottom left corner of the screen and allows you to navigate through the materials in a unit, like chapters in a book. The heading is autogenerated on the server side and contains info for generating links to materials. It also contains ordering data such as `order`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt`.

### MaterialTr

```
title: 'Большие надежды',
lang: 'ru',
for: 'materialId',
phrases: { materialPhrase1id: { text: 'Глава первая' } },
 createdBy: {
     userId: uid,
     userName: displayName
     },
 createdAt: 'timestamp[13]',
 updatedAt: 'timestamp[13]',
```

Translations for Material. Phrases ids are exactly the same as in Material. Both texts will be syncronyzed by them.

Each material can have only one translation for each language, and `translationId` = `materialId_trLang`.

`greatExpectationChapter1` --> `greatExpectationChapter1_ru` - a Russian translation for the material.

## Moderation flow

Every authorized user can add and edit materials. The earlier version of a document will be saved into the `revision` subcollection of a document. Every user has one cell for his revision. It's a garantee that the added/edited material will be saved and will be avaliable for you anytime. The app gets to publish the latest edition by default because every next user will do things based on the previous version and will have more opportunities to improve the material/translation. If the community desagrees with a certain editor, they can 'report' to the admins with a message stating the problem. It's for preventing malicios actions. After the admins have done the investigation, they can decide to ban the user who got to ruin the materials.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
